## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

### Create a special matrix object that can cache its inverse.

### Solve the inverse of the matrix, using the cached value if available.

## Write a short comment describing this function
### The makeCacheMatrix function creates a special "matrix" object that can 
### store a matrix and its inverse, enabling efficient caching of the inverse 
### to avoid redundant computations. It provides methods to set and get the 
### matrix, as well as to set and get its cached inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## Write a short comment describing this function

######## This function computes the inverse of a matrix (provided as x) and caches the result for subsequent calls, improving performance if the matrix is reused.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...){
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
